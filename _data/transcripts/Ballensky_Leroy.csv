LB, I try and get ahold of my boss see if I get some money they to eat on and stuff and I couldn't find him so that night my sister and I drove out to creed a little bit out by the dump her and I slept in the car for a couple of nights and we went back in town I found my boss and asked him if there's any way I can get some money so we can eat on so he asked he said well our company don't do that so he done it anyway and they advanced me some money and then when by the time we got there when there's someplace a house we could rent and I asked the guy that owned that house he had a store and it was a big cabin so my sister and I rented that out so her and I were standing there that's where she met her husband Pete and then going up there up to Butte got married and finally they were happily after you know that finally he passed away not too long ago so that's where my sister met her husband but we had some good times and we used go to the movies and stuff and that's where I met my first wife in Creed and we all used to go to the drive in and stuff like that and when we coming home from the drive-in I had some tires in my trunk which is just the car up and head lights were blinding off onto on-coming traffic is the state patrolman and I didn't have driver's license ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LB,but Pete did but they didn't have pictures of him on there so I told Pete give me your driver's license on the way to butte on their honeymoon if they got on a passing the patrolman stopped Pete and ask him what was going on cause he kept swinging having lazy eye and he ask that cop he says shh he couldn't hear his motor right he had some kind of noise and motor so he took petes license down and everything and send them on well when he got up to Butte he came back and I am and when we went to the driving one time had some tires in the trunk and this cop pulled us me over I told Pete give me your driver's license Pete so he gave me his driver's license and that cop wanted to see my driver's license he asked me get outside and I showed him my driver's license he looked at me and then he shined a light back there in the backseat and there's Gale and Pete he says didn't I stop you before yeah you stop me up on the pass I had a 58 Blue Chevy then he says what are you doing with this car well that chevy blew up in Butte and I bought this one and I cannot well what you got in the trunk and I said some tires I open the trunk she's well when you get home you take them tires out he says cause you're blinding everybody said OK so that's one incident we got by without getting caught that was pretty funny back and them days so yeah we had some good times then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HO,yeah what kind of education did you get? Education,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LB,I went far as the 9th grade is I didn't  graduate high school because I didn't have enough credit so I dropped out after 9th grade I dropped out of school but when I starting school in meaderville about 6 years old we had a first grade teacher named Miss sorcell and she was a  really mean teacher and sometimes during the day I would sleep in class and she put a note on my shirt and send me home and it said that I needed to go to bed early or something 'cause I sleeping in school well they never did wanna help me through school because when I got to junior high school all I done if I didn't cause any disturbing in the class or anything they would pass me onto the next grade and that's the way it went through clean-up to junior high school and one time when we was reading I didn't even know how to read in junior high when the teacher had each one of us read when they came to my turn I was scared and I was embarrassed I didn't know the teachers skip me and he told the kid behind me to read he said it's his turn he says why he says he's only here half the time so he don't know what's going on but in the first grade when the teacher had me to read and I didn't know how and she says why should he wanna learn all he's gonna do is become a miner like his dad so he don't need the education and so she never called on me for anything who really taught me about adding and subtracting was my older brother he taught me how to do that because the teacher didn't wanna take any time out to teach me so when I went to school and we had some adding I knew how to add them and all of a suddenly I got like a B on my paper and she thought I was cheating and she say how did you know that my brother taught me how to do this and after that I did good as far in adding and subtracting and that was it,education,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HO,well I'm glad you showed her,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LB,yeah she's supposed to be our teacher and she didn't even bother you know because my dad was a miner and she figured that's all I was gonna be us minors didn't need education cuz all we done is go in the ground and get the ore out but the people don't realize miners when they go in the ground get that are out that silver and gold and copper and iron and all other kinds of minerals that the car that there driving is made out of that metal that us miners put out risk our lives for and your pens your computers all your cameras everything you can imagine do with metal miners done that and if it wasn't for the miners they wouldn't have had all this stuff like silver they use silver and cameras and they needed that silver and if they didn't have it they wouldn't have no cameras so you know that they figured miner were just trashy people you know and when I become a miner you know that was surviving trying to support my family,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
