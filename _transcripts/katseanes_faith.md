This interview was conducted with my Grandfather, Rich Bowman. Rich is a nearly life-long resident of Idaho Falls, Idaho. Rich has been an Idaho Resident for most of his life, though his birth certificate specifies that he is technically a Montana native, living in Boseman Montana for the first four years of his life. For this interview, I based the questions primarily around school, media, and youth culture as Rich was a child and young teenager during the decade. Our interview touched on subjects like education, music, and big events at the time like the Vietnam war and Civil Rights. Overall this interview shows a tenured look into life in southern Idaho during the 1960s.
