Katherine Aiken was born in Sunnyside, Washington in 195. She grew up with her mother, father and her 3 younger siblings. Her father was a lawyer and WW2 veteran and had a practice in Sunnyside. Aiken described her childhood and life in Sunnyside as typical for a child of the 50s and early 60s, enjoying the newer technologies such as television and attending a traditional school. Sunnyside was a predominantly white community when Aiken was growing up, with the largest minority in the area being Hispanics. Aiken describes her family’s liberal views, and how she experienced a wide variety of social movements in her late teenage and early college years. These included the Civil Rights Movement, the Women’s Movement, the Anti-war Movement, and the Hispanic Rights Movement. Aiken wanted to highlight her perspective as a historian, and frequently described historical events more objectively, but she still goes into detail of what it was like to grow up in a rural area during this time and the general feelings of students at the University of Idaho during the late 1960s.
