Jody Sisk is my great aunt on my fathers side. Jody was born to Dennis and Willa Finley and raised in the Hazelton and Jerome area where she attended school and worked on the family farm. Jody moved to Western Washington in her early 20's and spent her early adulthood as a wife and mother and worked various jobs providing assistance to the public. Jody recently retired from the State of Washington where she worked for a number of years in the fuel tax division of The Department of Licensing as an auditor. Jody continues to maintain a strong relationship with her family; both those that still live in Idaho, and those that have migrated to Washington. In this interview Jody mentions that her brothers were in danger of being drafted during the Vietnam War; these brothers are Ed and Ted Finley, both older brothers of Jodys'. Ed Finley would go on to enlist in the airforce during the Vietnam War.
