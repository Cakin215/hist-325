My grandfather, Earl Fishburn was born in Pocatello, Idaho in 1937, where he was raised on a homestead along with his 3 siblings. He attended Idaho State University, before transferring and graduating from the University of Idaho. He graduated with a degree in forestry from the College of Natural Resources in 1959 and worked for around two years for the US Forest Service before being drafted at the age of 23. Earl served two years in occupied Berlin, before returning to the USFS. He would go on to work for the USFS for his entire career, and fight the Yellowstone Fire. Earl moved from small town to small town in Eastern Washington and Oregon for his work, before settling down in Heppner, Oregon with his wife and three children, including my father. Earl and my grandmother still live there, where they enjoy retirement.
