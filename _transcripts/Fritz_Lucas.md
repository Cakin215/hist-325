 This is an interview I conducted with my father, John Fritz. He was born on March 30th, 1954, in Salt Lake City, Utah, and moved to Boise, Idaho, when he was four years old. He attended Catholic elementary and high school in Boise and was raised in a Catholic family of 12. He is a life-long athlete and sports fan, playing a wide range of sports year-round growing up and earning a basketball scholarship to Boise State University. He played basketball there for one year before transferring and graduating from the University of Idaho. He has worked in public relations, sports management, education, coaching, and landscaping. Today, he lives in Boise and has two adult sons.
