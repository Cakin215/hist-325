	Kathleen Warren grew up in San Rafael, California, and attended the University of California Berkley in the early 1960s. She completed her education at the University of Idaho, where she earned three degrees: a bachelor’s in 1963, an M.F.A. in 1976, and a Ph.D. in “Higher Education Administration” in 1999 (“Kathleen Janine Warren (Kuehn)”). Warren argued that as a naive seventeen-year-old from a conservative household, she remained socially apathetic toward most issues but chose to educate herself about the “House Un-American Activities” who “[overstepped] their bounds” when they persecuted people based on their speech (Warren). This education awakened her “social consciousness,” which led to her participating in protests in San Francisco and joining the National Advancement for the Association of Colored People (Warren). However, Warren clarified her level of outrage when she claimed that she remained “apathetic” but chose to educate herself “about the injustices” committed by HUAC (Warren). She expressed her limited involvement in the protests but used her education as a form of activism to understand how America’s policies created social outrage. Warren retired in 2012 from her role as a “writer and development officer” for Washington State University and currently resides in Moscow, Idaho (“Kathleen Janine Warren (Kuehn)”).
