Leroy Ballensky was born in Butte, Montana in 1947. His town was very small in which he mainly was around his family. He is my grandfather and was a middle child with six other siblings. He grew up with little media and spent most of his time just trying to provide for himself and his family.
He mined for a majority of his life and he has since retired and is living in Henderson, Nevada.
